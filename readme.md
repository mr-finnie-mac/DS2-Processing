*Drone-based spatial 5G signal dataset and prediction algorithms consisting of telemetry and cellualr properties. Applied statistical, interpolative and learning methods*
Allows for solar modeling of stations using volume focused design.

See perfomance example below.

*We have Kriging, IDW, Ensemble method and parts (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM), UNET CNN and Our proposed method, a Gaussain Splatting based Transformer*

## Experiment Setup

![alt text](<CONF/field_photo.png>)

We use a drone fitted with a telemetry, cellular and environmental sensing payload, that logs it at regular intervals along a preplanned flightpath.

Circular rows: *2555m at 4m/s*
Circular  spiral: *1500m at 4m/s*
Cell tower location: lat/lon - *52.60818, 1.542818*, altitudeAMSL - *15.2m* (centre of flighpaths)
